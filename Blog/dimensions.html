<h5>What 5th dimension comes with</h5>
<p>
It is no longer surprising to anybody who has done any spiritual research or had any experiences with a spiritual world that there are more dimensions than just the matter one. 
<br/>
It is not only this generation looking for a deeper meaning in life. For centuries, it was a goal for poets, artists, scientists and simple people. 
<br/>
We are always on this quest to find what is yet to be discovered due to the craving for growth or importance in life. 
<br/>
The beauty of this process is that we start with the belief that we are in the centre of the Universe, and after going through the journey of self-discovery, crisis, self-doubt, and reformation, we eventually surrender to the understanding that we are indeed the centre of the Universe.
<br/>
It is not about finding a better place or dimension but becoming one. 
<br/>
<span class="special-text">Creating all there is. </span>
<br/>
When you truly grasp this concept, you will become the source of what you call your experience and run it. 
<br/>
It is called the Youniverse for a reason. What you put there, you receive, what you think you manifest with the strength of your feelings. 
<br/>
You just need to learn how to do it consciously and with responsibility. You are so powerful and not even knowing. 
<br/>

I can show you my other dimension, which I build and love strong enough to learn how to protect it. 
</p>

<p>
<h5>Abundance </h5>
I am not talking about money. Abundance is a type of energy which brings you fulfilment and happiness. 
<br/>
<span class="special-text">Wealth is a mindset</span>. Being satisfied with whatever you have. 
<br/>
That feeling of being on top of the World, keeping a simple, warm cap of coffee in your hands when you are cold after a rugged night camping with kids. Being grateful for your friends taking you to their camping slot at the seaside. And now you have 30 minutes before kids wake up and catch you making coffee using a gas stove instead of a campfire, as you promised.   
<br/>
Tell me what money can buy you this?!
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/camping.jpg" alt="camping"/>
People often forget what is the most precious in their life. Health.
You would not have money or this camping experience if you were ill. 
<br/>
If abundance is energy, it can come to you in different forms than money.
Protection, wisdom, luck. 
<br/>
I get items I desire for half price or almost for free sometimes. I always have money in my account, especially when I need something. I barely pay attention to it and do not know how I always get what I need. 
<br/>
I focus on abundance - my relationship with the Universe.  
</p>

<p>
<h5>Peace </h5>
I always thought that the most important things are survival, a sense of belonging and love. 
<br/>
It changed when I tasted peace. It is not even sweet and still so addictive. 
<br/>
Once you gain it, you will protect it with your life because suddenly, there will be nothing more precious. 
<br/>
It will give you not only that sense of eternal calmness, but you will also notice how your magical powers grow in this charming ocean of peace. 
<br/>
Your manifestaion powers. The ability to influence the Collective with just a thought, as yours, will have a higher vibrational charge and will become more likely to be picked up by others.  
<br/>
<br/>
Think about all these coincidences when somebody talked or acted the way you wanted them to. It mostly happens while you are experiencing Bliss.
<br/>
Pure and peaceful input into the Universe of yours expands and influences others. 
<br/>
This way, your peace is built. When propagated, it can get as suitable as your ways of finding it and showing others. 
<br/>
Remember to be kind to yourself. Do not expect anything. It already is. You are just uncovering it.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Enlightenment</h5>
You are not lost anymore. The question of who you are does make sense no more. It does not interest you when you can be whatever you want or simply nothing. 
<br/>
Anything that could have bothered you previously is not in your memory this time, as answering it would not be what you are after.
<br/>
When you realise you can have it all, you do not want to have anything anymore. 
<br/>
Maybe because it loses its value in these circumstances.
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/creator.jpg" alt="creator"/>

When you can channel higher vibing energies, your perspective and desires change.
<br/>
You become an observer of your own existence. 
<br/>
You know that everything that happens is just an experience you generated by yourself to understand and learn.
<br/>
At some point, learning becomes unnecessary, and you start influencing not only the closest environment but the whole Universe by creating new thoughts that your Collective has not experienced yet.  
<br/>
Enlightenment is a pathway to higher dimensions.
<br/>
 The one you are facing right now is about understanding that you are <span class="special-text">the Creator</span>.
