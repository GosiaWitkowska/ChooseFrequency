<h5>3 techniques to see synchronicities</h5>
<p>
Who would not want to be able to create their opportunities, their ways of faith unfolding? You can do it. But first, you need to see it at least. 
Most people do not understand that the law of attraction is about opportunities, possibilities, and nudges. <br/>
Your higher self creates it for you on your behalf until you merge your conscious mind with its consciousness. <br />
It will not bring you a fantastic partner but teach you how to recognise and avoid toxic ones. It will lead you eventually to the one which will match your energy. <br/>
Painful process? How else prevent you from self-sabotaging good opportunities? 
If you are not able to see the difference, you will be toxic yourself to the one you are meant to be with.<br/>
And all of that is done by synchronicities. Powerful chains of events which are meant to lead you towards a particular outcome. And it is always designed for your better good, even if it looks like a disaster. <br/>
Regardless of how much pain you might endure, remember elevation always comes with effort. <br/>
<span class="special-text">Stop complaining. Raise!</span>

<h5>Finding a reason in everything</h5>
<br/>
<div class="blog-quote">
"Everything happens for a reason<br/>
and a purpose, and it serves you."
<auth>~Tony Robbins</auth>
</div>
<br/>
Do you believe it? Why not? Who is the leading architect of your reality? You? Are you sure? <br/>
Did you want a divorce, stroke or death of a child? Who did it?
<br/>
Once, I was so scared. I had to organise documents for a tax office to prove the change to my centre of finances. It was challenging and scary as I neglected it, and they easily could have asked me to pay penalty. They did not. And I could not understand why I had this experience. Two years later, I had to apply for another country's nationality, and the whole process was so easy, thankfully, to the mentioned document. Coincidence or … synchronicity? 
I have more of them, more stressful but bringing much more powerful changes. I will write about them in my book. <br/>

It may be your higher self, a more advanced and developed version from the future. These evolved forms of you are in different dimensions where time and space do not exist. This is how they know what will happen and can set synchronicity either to prevent something from happening or make you do something which will result in something important later.<br/>
It might have been with you through many reincarnations already. And it might be why it gets tired sometimes and goes after radical solutions to wake you up. Like sickness or accidents. <br/>
When we start seeing synchronicities as meaningful, we are more likely to understand what needs to be done for us to ascend. Which means changing the form in which we manifest our energy. Less dense. Move to a different dimension or create a new one. <br/>
Your higher self is your primary guide in this journey. Don’t bite your teacher. Follow. See synchronicities. 
<p/>

<h5>Gratitude</h5>

Fear is the biggest enemy of progress and manifestation. We can not attract anything from a fear consciousness. <br/>
But there is a fantastic bio-weapon. Oxytocin - a powerful hormone that combats the adverse effects of stress. Practising gratitude is the best-known way of producing an extended amount of oxytocin. <br/>
Gratitude changes your self-talk and self-kindness and transforms your health.
It helps to be happier, less likely to suffer burnout and increases life satisfaction. Studies show that gratitude leads to better sleep, less fatigue, and less cellular inflammation. Lovers down cortisol levels.<br/>
Dopamine and serotonin, which help improve moods, are released during gratitude practice.

But if all in your life is orchestrated by your higher self, why not be appreciative and encourage it to do more of it? Would you like not getting any recognition for your work? 
You can not even imagine how many synchronicities need to be set up to make you suffer enough to wake you up from the matrix! You are meant to merge with your higher self and become one. Follow its instructions.

<h5>Opening Third Eye chakra</h5>

Discernment is a skill and a gift granted when we open the third eye chakra. You will see more things behind the veil between seen and undefined by blocked perception. <br/>
This World is fully available only to people who can regulate their body and mind cycles. It is essential to calm down on demand or almost hibernate when we get downloads from the Divine.  <br/>
Meditation helps slow down the thinking process and verify which thoughts we want to focus on. But to be able to produce the brain-heart coherence which is necessary for the law of attraction, we need something more powerful. <br/>
You will not find anything better than melatonin. It is a hormone produced by the brain's pineal gland. It plays a  crucial role in regulating the body's circadian rhythm. Melatonin secretion is triggered by darkness and inhibited by light. <br/>
The Pineal Gland is often referred to as the third eye. <span class="special-text">Open it!</span><br/>
 It is the gate to your manifestation and seeing.
