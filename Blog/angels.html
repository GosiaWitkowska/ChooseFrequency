<h5>Angelic intervention</h5>
<p>
Is your intuition whispering to you, your higher self directing you, your spirit guides showing you something? They really do not care how you call them or see them. They mostly come in the form you feel safe and familiar with.
<br/>
They are just energy, light if you prefer. More and more people learn to recognise them every day. They are present not only in religions. Spiritual people, who do scientific research, talk about them openly too. Joe Dispenza, Gregg Braden, Bruce Liption.

And you think about all these situations where somebody from nowhere appeared to give you crucial information or when they acted out of their normal behaviour. 
<br/>
Yes. They can penetrate any energy of their choice which has lower vibration. Yours too. 
Is it possession or rescuing? Your choice. 
I always welcome their energy. This light in me.
<br/>
I loved when they waited for me at the bus stop as a smiling, young person to tell me which bus would take me back home, when I was totally lost in the middle of the night in London. It looked like this man's only task in life. 
<br/>
What more can they do?
</p><p>
<h5>Intervention</h5>
I am a hypnotherapist and a tarot reader. And in tarot there is the card called the Tower. It symbolises the need for a Divine Intervention to take you out of a wrong path and show the right one. 
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/tower.jpg" alt="Tarot tower"/>
It can come with painful realisations or actions. In my case it was a burglary or divorce. Both situations changed my life. First caused the location change for much better and the second one ended the toxic relationship with a narcissist, triggering my spiritual awakening and healing from the trauma bond. 
<br/>
It would always be something drastic enough to wake you up. It never comes unexpected really as before you get many warnings. But due to your own limitations of social influence you often discard them. Until it just shakes the fundations and forces us to build a new, better one.
<br/>
Yes. It is them. Angels, spirit guides taking you out before it collapses. Just in the nick of time. You can trust that their support is guaranteed after this. They will help you to rebuild a much better and more significant foundation if you follow their instructions. 
<br/>
When you find yourself and start listening to your intuition, which is a tool to communicate. And look around as they will set up many synchronicities for you. 
</p><p>
<h5>Thoughtful possession</h5>

Angels can penetrate any energies they want. Demons on the other hand need permission. 
But would you worry if for a moment you would shine and be amazing for example during a presentation or knowing how to oversmart an enemy, even if it was not fully you?
<br/>
I do not. I love it. When I do my public speaking training I ask them for assistance and I become â€¦ talented. Unstoppable. You learn during the process too. 
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/public_speaking.jpg" alt="public speaking"/>
There is a rule though. They can dense energy to match your frequency and possess you for as long as close your vibrations are to theirs. Higher vibing entities can not even come close if our vibrations are too low. 
<br/>
I encountered angelic help coming through other people too. When I needed comforting as I was going through a difficult time. Look for strange behaviour. Somebody who would never be nice suddenly becomes a crying shoulder. Only temporarily till you heal. After that this person will be back empty. In this case they will inform you of their departure. And do not feel upset as they can not stay for long as there is a cost involved. 
<br/> 
When you meet somebody only once, who tells you something so personal and critical that changes your life. Mostly in these situations that person will be even able to foresee what would happen if you use that information. And after that meeting you would not be able to find that person ever again. 
</p><p>
<h5>Premonition</h5>
Strong feeling that something is about to happen. Come on. Is there anybody who has never experienced visions? 
<br/>
You can call it however you wish, it still will be a premonition. To warn you or others. To change the course of events. To rescue.
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/eye.jpg" alt="Premonition"/>
<br/>
They show you what it might be if you do not change your actions. They can make it so vivid that you will feel paranoid. It only means how much they love you and want you to avoid your faith. 
<br/>
They often use dreams to show us danger. For example when I am in the wrong environment I always dream about escaping a gang. On a daily basis until I change that and release these people. 
<br/>
When you ask angels how to do it or what to do, they will show you using dreams or other ways. You will be drawn to watch a movie to experience a breakthrough. Or many people around you will be talking about a particular event, opportunity. And it will be exactly the place for you or source of inspiration. 
<br/>
Pay attention to all these signals, nudges. They use your inner voice, intuition to send messages.
