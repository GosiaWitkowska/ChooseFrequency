<h5>Signs you are already in a higher dimension</h5>
<p>
What we do not perceive by our five senses does not exist. Let's not be silly. <br/>
We see only a small light spectrum range from 400 to 700 nm. Rest is not visible to the human eye, at least to those who don't want to see more.
</p>
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/solar-spectrum.jpg" alt="solar spectrum"/>
<p>
We can hear only a small portion of sound ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. But dolphins and bats can hear frequencies over 100kHz. Elephants can hear sound at 14-16Hz, while some whales can hear infrasonic sounds as low as 7Hz.
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/champ_auditif_en2.jpg" alt="auditory range"/>
</p><p>
Let's talk about brainwave frequencies. These waves range from 12Hz to 38Hz. 
Gamma (awareness), Beta (alertness), Alpha (relaxed, ready to be hypnotised), Theta (tired), Delta (Sleep).
But I am listing only human’s brain capabilities. Research shows that animals can produce unusually slow waves, cycling twice a second.<br/>
These waves were very strong, suggesting a high level of synchronisation between neurons. And it mostly happened when octopuses were synchronising their movements. Telepathy? But this includes  the heart neurons. People do not yet understand that looking only at the main brain is only the beginning. The whole mystery behind creation is in coherently synchronising both neuron’s centres.
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/brainheartcohirance.jpg" alt="Heart Brain Coherence"/>
</p><p>
The heart contains an intrinsic nervous system that exhibits short and long-term memory functions. The heart's intrinsic nervous system consists of approximately  40,000 neurons called sensory neurites which relay information to the brain.
And it is most likely to see communication  going from the heart to the brain. It looks like our brain relies on information from our heart. 
<br/>
If humans think they see, hear, and sense all and that there is no more than we truly deserve, we only recognise these five senses. If humans think they see, hear, and sense all and that there is no more than we truly deserve only, these five senses we recognise.<br/>
What if there is more, and you could access different frequencies, develop new skills and experience unseen, unknown … dimensions?<br/>
Something not accessible … yet. 

</p><p>
<h5>Becoming invisible</h5>

When we go through a transformation, we change. It is inevitable. It should not surprise us more than others. What do I mean by that?
Don’t be disappointed when people will stop understanding you or even noticing. 
They can not walk with you along the road they do not see. And you can not go back to the one they are on. 
You raise your vibrations when you seek more. You see what you can have and experience. <br/>
And what is more profound is that you know you can not find it where you have been before. 
You talk differently, You behave differently. You do not react anymore to certain triggers because they lose meaning in your eyes. And because of that, you can not be controlled anymore by others or the environment itself. 
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/invisable-man.jpg" alt="Invisible man"/>

Sooner or later, these people will stop seeing your energy. Humans need to comprehend what they experience. Otherwise, it is irrelevant to their perception. 
You might be willing to dense your energy temporarily to be able to communicate.<br/>  
But when you start attracting your new soul tribe, you will not have time or desire to chase previous roles.
Your frequency will become noticeable only by different entities. These amplify it by aligning together. You will want to become an entity from a different dimension as you will start seeing more of yourself there. 

</p><p>
<h5>Seeing more synchronicities</h5>

Recently I wrote another article about synchronicities, explaining what they are and their important role in our lives. These are no numeric sequences but rather synchronised events any energy to benefit us. People call them coincidences by mistake. It is possible to generate them yourself and control them. <br/>
Seeing synchronicities and recognising their meaning is the start of the journey that can change not only your life but your existence as well. 
Human civilisation is meant to progress, expand, grow, and evolve. This is a time for another gens revolution. We are capable of developing capabilities beyond the five common senses. And it only depends on us, what it will be, and those who will participate in the process. Believe in yourself and your downloads. <br/>
One soul, one mind, one divne awareness is enough to change it all. This was the main reason why the whole Consciousness divided. To speed up the experience and have more chances to create new things. This is why it is important for you not get biased by any norms and go wild with your imagination. 
Depending on which dimension you occupy, you get particular access to heightened awareness and its resources. 
We have first to start seeing it. It’s power and abilities. 
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/concious.jpg" alt="concious"/>
How something else than just faith shapes our World. Nothing's a coincidence. Might sound like a slogan but when you start examining it, you will find a World of magic … not from the third dimension. 

</p><p>
<h5>Body and Mind changes</h5>

There is no other way to allow a transformation than letting it in and letting it raise your vibrations. How? Let it rule you for a moment, and learn how to do it yourself. 
<br/>
During a spiritual awakening, you experience voices, feelings, and urges for new, different or even strange things. Go for it. Let this frequency enter your body, and learn all about it. Be a radio for a moment and play the music you capture from the weather just tune in to a new frequency. Start changing it to the point when it will resonate with your soul. It will be a sign your Higher Self found its reality. 
<br/>
To shift to a different dimension, they (spirit guides, entities) must change your brain flexibility. It is why you might feel addicted to learning and courses. 
<br/>
They need to change your cellular structure to let you live longer. I wrote before about ways to extend our DNA chromosomes by extending telomeres. <br/>
This is why you gradually stop eating meat, sugar, and heavy meals. Food, in general, might stop interesting you. 
<br/>
They need to change your focus. It is why suddenly you will realise that you do not remember when you watched the last episode of your favourite drama or TV. 
You will not be able to chat with your friends anymore because you will not know where there is a War and who won football recently. 
<br/>

average minds discuss events, <br/>
weak minds discuss people." <br/>

They are clearing your mind as you are meant to start seeing a different dimension where maybe War, football, money and food do not exist anymore. 
<br/>
After that, you have a choice to make. Are you asking what is there? Magic.
Your own World. You can make whatever you want. It belongs to you. Your dimension. 
Where would you find better entertainment if you did not create it yourself? 
<br/>
Really. Show me what you can come up with!
