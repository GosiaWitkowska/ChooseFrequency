<h5>Healing Narcissism With Spirituality: A Powerful Transformation</h5>
<p>
Narcissists are drawn to spirituality, especially in older age. Due to a lack of empathy or reduced access to it, they seek help and redemption in higher powers.</br>
They don’t trust or submit to any human, but they crave something or somebody to tell them everything will be fine. Now and after death. </br>
Narcissists might act like non-believers, non-superstitious, and not devoted to practices. </br>
Not true. <span class="special-text">They need it like air.</span></br>
Mainly because they are insecure deep inside, they never had a proper caregiver or parent. They have never been hugged when they were young, and because of that, they never allow anybody to hug them later. They just do not want to feel disappointed again. </br>
The majority of their relationships of any sort fail, primarily due to their poor social skills. It does not help; instead, it creates more wounds in their already fragile inner child. </br>
But like every human, they need somebody or something that could love them unconditionally. What else, if not Higher Power, can see their pain and sympathise with them? They are loved and ever will be. This can transform them. Certainty. </br>
How?</br>
I can show you what they want and try to find in spirituality.
</p>
<p>
<h5>Seeking protection </h5>
</p>
Often from themselves, as at the time when they turn towards spirituality, they alredy know that there is something wrong with them or at least that others do not easily tolerate them. </br>
It is a time when all their manipulations and coping tactics might have stopped working or are inefficient. </br>
With age, they deal with older and smarter people or simply attract only what they are. This way, they can easily surround themselves with other difficult and sneaky energies. </br>
They have deep insecurities, narcissistic wounding, and poor coping mechanisms. </br>
They have never been properly protected and loved. </br>
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/family.jpg" alt="dimension"/>
With time, they just got more proof that success in any relationship is impossible. </br>
They lose hope and trust in humans, and they start looking elsewhere.</br>
The spiritual ideology of believing in yourself, self-empowerment and that the Universe always gives you what you deserve makes them feel understood for once. </br>
It all seems designed for them. And this new concept that you are the Universe, if taken the wrong way, is just a pure definition of narcissism, isn't it? </br>
We are the Universe, but only in our reality. </br>
They seek protection and understanding. Something humanity more often refuses to give them, forgetting that they are emotionally wounded children with a broken inner child.</br>
Should not the World be more compassionate? Are we still empaths when we hate people in need?
<p>
<h5>Craving unconditional love </h5>
</p>
Parental love is important. Rather essential in everybody’s development. Nobody would ever argue with this, especially parents. </br>
We all had mum and dad. </br>
These memories of your mum’s million kisses around your wounded knee after you failed from a bike.  </br>
Your dad’s clumsy attempts to kiss your forehead for goodnight without waking you up after coming home late.</br>
His breath still smelled like beer after his company party. And this unbelievable feeling that he can not sleep without first ensuring you are fine. </br>
Or wait, wait …  your granny bitting crap out of your dad during Christmas because he raised a voice at you for opening presents too early. For her, you are royalty, and in her presence, nobody touches you. Do you remember that? They do not. </br>
They have opposite memories. They feel that they would be better off without parents. </br>
They regret that nobody came and took them to an orphanage when they were little. They would have had more chances there because they would have to stand up only to people equal to them, just other kids. </br>
They did not experience unconditional love when they were little; they never got it from humans, and they have never healed. </br>
I know that once you show them that you will be with them no matter what, they eventually stop fighting and put down the guard. </br>
<span class="special-text">Spirituality gives them that fantasy.</span> 
<p>
<h5>Wanting to change the World for the better</h5>
Sounds absurd? Narcissists, especially at a later age, want to improve the World. </br>
They truly feel it is their calling. </br>
In psychology, the most progressive healing happens while transmuting pain into creativity, and even more profound changes can be seen when it becomes a source of others’ recovery.</br>
Narcissists are not different. Their intuition eventually leads them towards helping people as a process of self-healing. </br>
Their grandiosity takes them further than just looking at a few people. They want a group or the whole Globe to need them.</br>
Do you find it wrong? Why? What can go wrong with somebody trying to reach a broader audience to share helpful advice? </br>
They are knowledgeable as they focused their whole life on getting better than others to survive. </br>
Narcissists often are business owners, CEOs, managers, and directors. </br>
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/businessman.jpg" alt="dimension"/>
They have access to resources and helpful people. We should encourage them to change the world for the better. They would do it with pleasure. Guess what else would happen? They would recover. </br>
Let them. </br>
They know, like nobody else, what to avoid. <span class="special-text">What pain is.</sapn> </br>
