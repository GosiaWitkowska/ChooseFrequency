<h5>3 powers in seeing others - attracting higher vibrations</h5>
<p>
<div class="blog-quote">
“I see you. I truly see you.”
</div>
Even when you are not here  I see your energy. I know and understand it. Because of that I can notice myself. How?
<br/>
Please reverse the sentence “I see you” and you will get “You see I”. Yourself. Only then I will see myself.  
<br/>
If we are one Collective. One Consciousness having many experiences in this fragmented experiment called life. Then when you make another person look at themself with love, you will express it to yourself. 
<br/>
I look at it as a spell. We are enchanted by programming to seek external validation. Always wanting others to accept us and praise. Not knowing that the spell breaker is hidden in us. You have to find love for yourself within you to the point that it will be fully satisfying.

Could you imagine the strength and confidence you can possess when you stop requiring it from others and find it within yourself? You would become untouchable, unstoppable, protected. Not by angels or guides or God. Oh no. They would not have to do it anymore. They are not meant to. By your own energy, vibration, aura, power. 
<br/>
But if you have a problem with finding it, there is an easier path to turn it on. Seeing first others and because we are one this way you will acknowledge yourself automatically. 
</p><p>
<h5>Love</h5>

It is an emotion, feeling with a frequency of 528Hz. Everybody craves to experience it. Majority of people associate it with an external feeling for another person. Romantic love, parental love, friendship love. But it is just affection as its source is external.
<br/>


Love as an emotion with a greater frequency, which can uplift us and change our life, is the one which holds power in itself. It does not depend on others' choices or mercy.  It is the one always present, stable and loyal. The one when found will stay forever with you. The one that see you fully and truly and can not stop watching you. 
<br/>
In its purest form - YOU.
<br/>

<br/>

The closest things are most difficult to notice. What can be more devoted to you if not you yourself. You need to just fall in love with yourself. 
One of the most difficult tasks we have to accomplish in one of our lifetimes. 
<br/>
And there is a way to make it easier. USing a power of the “I see you” concept. When you start noticing, praising, adoring others you help them to reverse the sentence and let them see “I”. Themselves. 
<br/>
I promise you will feel it as a task accomplished. As if making somebody love themself makes your mind not resisting it for itself anymore. We are just One. 
</p><p>
<h5>Confidence<h5/>
One of the most desired qualities and the one which sells itself. Confident people seem to have it all, become magnetic and can influence environments and others. It comes with responsibility and high frequency. It makes people feel amazing and untouchable. 
<br/>
But confidence by definition is not only a feeling of self assurance arising from appreciation of yours’s abilities. It is as well a belief that you can have faith in or rely on someone else.
<br/>
Is it a coincidence that these two things were given the same name?
I do not believe in coincidences. I see them as synchronicities. We were meant to see both as related. It means that having faith in others will generate desired confidence in you. 
<br/>
Are you asking how to do it? “I see you”.
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/group.jpg" alt="I see you."/>

Faith in others is simply seeing them and trusting that what they do is exactly what they need right now. Whatever they do, think, talk about is right. You trust them. You see and understand. You love them, 
<br/>
Tell me to hack how you would not feel confident surrendered by people you love and trust? 
Sounds like a trick? Give it a go and raise. 
</p><p>
<h5>Resonance</h5>

Resonance is a phenomenon which occurs with all types of vibrations and waves: mechanical, acoustic, electromagnetic. Even electrons have its spin resonance. 
<br/>
Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency. Small periodic forces that are near a resonant frequency of the system have the ability to produce larger amplitude oscillations.

And it is so relevant to us - people. We generate vibrations at a particular frequency. You can heighten it to an unbelievable, World changing level by putting yourself in a higher vibrating and consistent environment because we influence each other. 
This external force will tend your system to reverberate in higher amplitude other than its natural amplitude along its preferred frequency.

There is a problem though. With finding like-minded people, who we feel confident with to trust them to influence us.
It might take a lifetime if it ever happens as your mind might crave science but you might not have the opportunity to access the appropriate environment. I ask why to wait? 
<br/>
Make your own World. Make people around you respond in similar frequency to amplify the change opportunity. How? 
<br/>
Start with seeing them. Apply the “I see you” formula. People crave being seen. They will align with your energy. Remember to be patient. When you seek people to increase frequencies the Universe will deliver. 
<br/>
At the end of the day, everybody is you.
