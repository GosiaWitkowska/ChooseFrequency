<h5>3 benefits of aligning with Schumann Resonance - Earth's frequency</h5>
<p>

The Schumann Resonances are a set of frequencies produced by electromagnetic waves in Earth’s lower ionosphere. It’s created by thunderstorms and lightning around the Globe. It’s called Earth’s heartbeat. It matches the frequency of human alpha brain waves. 
<br/>
Discovered by Winfreid Otto Schumann in 1952.
NASA  scientists conduct research on how it influences humans. 
This resonance goes up to about 60 miles above in the lower ionosphere part of the atmosphere and stays there for some time to capture electromagnetic waves. 
<br/>
The Schumann Resonance of 7.83Hz has also been linked by some specialists to hypnosis, meditation and even human growth hormones. To benefit from it you have to be in a quiet and comfortable place.
Being aligned with this frequency means a peaceful mind and a better recognition of reality. And with it an easier life. Which I believe is always worth investing into.
I want to show you 3 things you can gain when you align with this frequency.

<h5>Body and mind healing</h5>

Schumann resonance activates your body’s healing abilities. There is a reason why people call it a “heartbeat”. If you align your frequency with Earth’s highest-intensity waves, your mind and body will receive its healing resonance.

When I had a heap problem I could not walk. I demanded it during a Christmas party but a few days later we had to isolate due to covid. It was the most peaceful time in my life. I started meditating more. I do not watch TV. Nobody could visit me. I experienced solitude . I aligned. You can feel its presence in your home, heart, mind, and …. heap.  
Today I do not remember which heap it was. Really. 
<br/>
Losing hair due to age or stress is not an issue anymore. I have never had more hair. 
I am almost 50 and I do not feel like it at all. I have never been more active. 
I used to get depressed quite often in the past. Not anymore. I do not even remember the symptoms. How it feels. Like I was a completely different person.
<br/>
I have never been more creative. To learn something new takes me approximately a few days. Spiritual people call it being tapped into the Collective Consciousness.  
Yes - I am as long as I can stay peaceful and do not disconnect. You can feel it. 
Constant downloads and not-ending synchronicities. 
Your crown chakra is wildly open and shiny. You can check it on your aura reading.

<h5>Magically attracting opportunities</h5> 
Yes. You read it right. I call it magic. It works like one. Synchronicities which you generate. Creating a wave of information and aligning with Schumann Resonance strengthens the signal and lets more parts of Global Consciousness know what you need. 
And then you can see a miracle forming. Stronger you are connected, the faster it will manifest. 
Example? Indeed pink heels. Yes, shoes. It had more meaning to me at the time. But it is not about it. I couldn’t find any and the one I saw some time ago was already gone. 
You just use thoughts like “an order” and your heartbeat as an emitter. If you align with the Earth’s one it will be distributed faster and further. Might even reach other consciousnesses. There are many. Duality exists, singularity we meant to create. And this is one of ways to connect, make each other know about its presence. By creating synchronicities, which demands collaboration on energetical level.
When your signal is strong enough it can travel further back and forward on your timeline. Into the past and future. To set synchronicities for whatever you require now. 
Difficult to believe. Why not try and discover the amazing World of magic.

I surfed online again and I found my perfect pink shoes on sale in one of my favourite shops. But I wanted to get it cheaper. I was short on money at that time. One more impulse to the weather and I got it half price on amazon. 
<br/>
This technique can be used on anything. There are rules to obey. Mostly pure intention and pure heart is a must be. I set synchronicities with people’s involvement only when I feel in danger or I need help. 
It is important to work on your protection too. When we start reaching for bigger things than just shoes it can get tricky as we let the Collective see and access our energy. As we can use it, it can use ours too. Sometimes we can be used in return for decreasing our karma. It is why pure intentions are vital. Thankfully to them, we might not get more exposed to other energies. 
<br/>
It is possible to set up synchronicities for others too. But you would have to create a strong protection as getting that huge access to Higher Consciousness opens yours to others too. Basically when the traffic gets bigger you are more likely to experience a collision. But with time you get better and better at it. You can “earn” your energy to be clocked (hidden) by doing good deeds.
<br/>
Would it not be a magical way of experiencing this reality? Setting it up ourselves. Everybody can. We just need to know or wake up. 
<br/>
Your mind can create entire Worlds out of the ordinary.

<h5>Becoming a people’s reader</h5>
When you align with the most present vibration of all, you will start seeing, feeling, and understanding any anomalies including other people's vibrations.  
With practice you will be able to know if these are lower or how much lower in comparison with yours. 
When I started seeing it I thought I could hear people’s thoughts. Telepathy is possible but not using Schumann Resonance. With this you can recognise, feel people’s intentions. 
We emit vibrations on a particular frequency.

You can become like a lie detector if you stay tuned to something which mostly surrounds all of us. Almost becoming it. There is no chance you will not feel distributions and discrepancies from this base frequency. 
Sounds great but comes with the cost. You will not be able to be around people for a long time. 
It will start being painful as these differences can become like pinches or cuts. Stronger manifester creates further waves and can penetrate a bigger chunk of Consciousness without even realising. 
You might even end up craving escape from crowded places or your location in general. If you stay tapped in for too long you might become like a “caveman” not only by choice but by necessity. 
<br/>
I call it a journey to your freedom. It starts with knowledge. Only by knowing who you are and what is around you, you can decide where you want to be.
