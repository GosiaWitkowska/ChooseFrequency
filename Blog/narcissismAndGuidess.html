<h5>Dealing with narcissism teaches you to become a spirit guide</h5>
<p>
Would you like that? Would you like to work for light and bring back lost souls? Who else can do it if not you? Your spirit guides gave you knowledge, powers, and strength. You know everything about this condition. You created your theories and ways to cope with it. Why not use it for better good? </br>
Helping other survivors is a fantastic purpose. I hope you see it too. But there is something better for those who want to play this game on a higher level. </br>
Spirit guides are entities who lead, help, and rescue. But not people with empathy as these can do it themselves. They aim for narcissists, and they want to recruit you to help them. </br>
People who have children with a narcissist would not question this idea. Narcissism gets passed through generations, and they might need to know how to love their kids in the future. </br>
If your parents have been a nightmare, but you are a good person and want to help them when they get older, you might learn how to avoid getting triggered while dealing with them. </br>
You might understand your siblings switching off their empathy to survive. They did not have your strength. </br>
There is a reason why narcissism has similar features to autism. It is a personality dysfunction and, when not treated, can lead towards a brain disorder and presents itself with socialisation issues like autism. </br>
The price is enormous because it involves their quality of life and often losing you. But it does not have to be this way.</br>
Your compassion and specific tactics can allow you to come close to them and not get harmed. Become <span class="special-text">a lightworker</span> and help to turn people back towards humanity.

<h5>Passion</h5>
Being in the flow is about using gamma brainwaves. Time and space do not exist. You are one with your creation, and there is nothing else. Everybody felt it and wanted more of it. </br>
They did, as well. </br>
Narcissists have passions. Often, they can not sustain this feeling for longer as they can not fall in love with their craft when they do not have empathy. They feel mostly anger and resentment, as these low-vibing emotions are easy and possible to generate without it. </br>
Cravings do not need empathy, though. These come regardless of whether you practice love or not. </br>
I discovered that this is the only way to a narcissist's heart. When you support and motivate them regularly to do what they crave. It is not easy as they lose interest after 5 minutes, but it is not about them; it is about you gaining their trust. </br>
Do not practice their passion with them. They will take it as a competition. Just be their biggest fan and always encourage them. This way, they will let you close to their heart.</br>
But do not disappoint them after that, as you will be the biggest enemy if you do. Their narcissistic wounds are in the heart. Do not make more.</br>
This trick will stop working if you get romantically involved with them. Narcissists think love is S E X. You can not mix it; otherwise, they will think you are just another illusion in their life. 
</p>
<p>
<h5>Trust</h5>
They have been disappointed their whole life while being humans still. I guess up to the age of five. They will not trust anybody. They can not. It is lethal to them. They suffered the most from people who were supposed to love them. </br>
Never demand a narcissist to trust you. You do not need it. Let them be and make them feel safe. You see it all, and you only need to understand why. They will abandon this energy-consuming activity when it stops working for them. </br>
They always look for ways to keep you under control or to compete with you for a position. All of it out of fear. Let them. It does not cost you anything.

It should not phase you. Otherwise, you are not ready to tame them. </br>
When they understand that their tactics do not work on you and regardless of how cruel they are, you never give up on them, they will accept you … as a person to whom they can show their true face. And they will not be scared of you having their back as they will know you will not stub them. This whole game is to prevent anybody from betraying them … again and opening their narcissistic wounds from their childhood. 
</p>
<p>
<h5>Protection</h5>
Narcissists' whole life is about fear. They are scared of their own shadow as they do not trust anybody, even themselves. It is not only miserable but harmful. </br>
They crave somebody to take care of them. Somebody they never had but knew was needed.<span class="special-text"> A parent. </span>
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/child.jpg" alt="child"/>
This is why, often in romantic relationships, they demand their partners to take this role. And still, their lack of trust in people prevents them from appreciating it when they find somebody who will agree to play this game. </br>
But you can use something which they do not associate with humans but still find powerful enough to think that it can protect them. Spirituality. Higher powers. This works. </br>
When you make a narcissist believe in something that makes decisions for them in their best interest, they will feel safe for once. </br>
It can create many benefits as they will find directions in it, following concepts like <span class="special-text">self-love and energy work</span>.</br>
The idea it provides of creating their own reality will help them to get out of victimhood where they were placed once. </br>
Narcissists are people without empathy and, because of that, without imagination and access to energy… mostly their own. They need directions, but they do not trust people. Give them something they can.
