<h5>Raising vibrations to manifest faster.</h5>
<p>
Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths, lowest frequencies, and least amount of energy. Humans create electromagnetic fields, too. It would mean we can broadcast frequencies and send and receive messages energetically.
<br/>
We can tune to different frequencies and vibrations as any receiver and emitter of waves. The length of it, which we send to the either, is profoundly connected with its strength.   
<br/>
Our reality, life, and opportunities depend on it’s quality. More significant manifestations demand a wider span of influence on energy around. 
<br/>
When you are interested in finding a new partner, your energy might send this information only as far as the street you live on. But if you raise your vibrations, you might reach an audience as far as the Globe. Energetically, you can call in anybody who resonates with your vibrations.

The same rule applies to any other opportunity, like a new job. It can come unexpectedly from many places to your doorstep in the offer letter if you become a magnetic vortex for the World to work for you. 
<br/>
How to do it? <span class="special-text">Raising vibrations</span> for manifestations.
<br/>
You can use three main ingredients, which I will describe below.
<br/>
<p/>
<p>
<h5>Getting addicted to powerful habits</h5>
Habits that raise <span class="special-text">dopamine production</span> in your body. The hormone is responsible for memory, movement, pleasure reward, and … that much-wanted and needed motivation. 
<br/>
Having a lot of dopamine in our bloodstream keeps us going and prevents us from giving up. 
<br/>
Consistency is the most important in each manifestation, starting with simple weight loss or business creation. From my experience, it is one of the most challenging features. Doing something repeatedly against all odds, like temptations to drop it or people’s disbelief. But only consistency can guarantee success. 
<br/>
It is easier than we think, and when applied correctly, it can become addictive, as dopamine is. 
<br/>
The best is to start with a small effort but repeat it regularly and add to it when it gets easy. Like ten squads per day at first or quick reels below one minute for your business page. 
Before you notice, you will become slim and famous.

<p>
<h5>Emotional detachment</h5> 
Nothing is more destructive than discourageable influences where your emotional involvement can worsen it.
<br/>
People manifest using their energetical vortex (Esther Hicks).

"The more you think of things that please you, the better you will feel. <br/>

</div>
It means the human’s electromagnetic field plays the main role in their manifestations.
<br/>
This field is produced by the mechanism where <span class="special-text">the heart is an engine</span>. It has to be free from disheartening emotions. Otherwise, the field will be weak. 
<br/>
You have to be able to open your heart chakra entirely to create a strong impulse. Learning how to maintain and overpower your emotions is the key. 
<br/>
You can not let anything or anybody manipulate your emotions, as it directly impacts the strength of your powers, like creating your vortex. The stronger it is, the faster it bends your reality and brings opportunities to you without you having to do much. 
<br/>
It is why you need to learn to control your emotions and detach from anything that no longer serves you.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Uniqueness - Authenticity.</h5>
Everybody says that love is the highest emotional vibration, which brings balance and correct resonance at the heart level. 
<br/>
The latest research of many institutions shows authenticity has a higher vibration than love and can attract positivity and manifestations faster (Scale of Positive and Negative Experience - SPANE scale).
<br/>
When what you say and feel matches your actions, you open up the most for what is yours. You create the easiest way for the Universe to deliver, and you do not confuse it or yourself. 
<br/>
Consistency and confidence demand courage. And when you gather all these three qualities, no force can stop you. 
When you see that even the Universe falls under this rule, you will not allow any human to prevent you from becoming the centre of your creation. You can achieve it only when you are YOURSELF.
