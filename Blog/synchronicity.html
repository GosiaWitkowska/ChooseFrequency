<h5>How to respond to a synchronicity. 3 ways to generate more of them.</h5>
Have you ever been buying something online and there were problems? You lost the Internet for a moment, the website page refreshed itself, you did not notice there was one more confirmation button? Was it something expensive or something you did not need to buy or have? It was your synchronicity set by your higher self to prevent you from making unnecessary mistakes as this lesson you do not have to go through anymore or this time. 
<br/>
It can be the other way around. Once I wanted to go to the Teal Swan workshop as a VIP guest and have a chance to talk with her. I did not have money for it. I had only a standard seat. But I was in the middle of remortgaging and just a few weeks before I was sent back overpayments on my mortgage during the transfer. It was exactly the difference between a standard seat and a VIP one. If you listen to your intuition it will even tell you what to calculate and where to look for money. My higher self wanted this experience. It was beneficial to my evolution.

Have you ever had a problem getting to a place to meet your new date? As it turned out later on it was a dangerous person. <span class=”speacial-text”>Protection</span>.
<br/>
Have you ever been stuck in a train and could not attend an event? It was not meant for you to be there. Waste of time or you had to avoid something. <span class=”speacial-text”>Prevention</span>.
<br/>
Have you ever felt lucky because you followed nudges and said yes to the party your friend organised? And you met your future partner there? <span class=”speacial-text”>Faith</span>.
<br/>
You decided to meet her there  and you energetically influenced your friend to invite you both. Having access to the Collective Consciousness we can setup many types of synchronicities.

<h5>Notice and learn</h5>
It is not easy to see or believe it. This is why we have helpers, teachers, and guides. They teach us how to do it ourselves by setting synchronicities on our behalf when we are ready to learn.
