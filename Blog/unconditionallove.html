<h5>Narcissistic relationship teaches all involved about unconditionl love</h5>
<p>
Everybody is equal. Everybody should have a chance. Really? </br>
What if some people are on a different level, and their karmic lessons this lifetime are not about experiencing <span class="special-text">your unconditional love</span> but giving their own? </br>
You might be here just to learn to recognise people’s lessons and act accordingly. Your energy was given this opportunity to elevate to a higher rank in a spiritual realm and become a guide for those who need it the most.  </br>
There are rules which can help you change your mindset and see more. It works like taking that thin veil out of your eyes and graduating. Diamonds are made under enormous pressure. </br>
Mostly, your narcissistic relationship should show you your value and teach you how to recognise who is ready for your impact. There is nothing wrong with leaving people to their karmic faith, even if they are about to repeat a known pattern. </br>
Your unconditional love can rescue everybody by providing spiritual protection, manifesting in this realm as miracles. Narcissists know it. Dealing with them is your chance to find it out, too.</br>
You are here to see and understand that sometimes, the lack of miracles is the only way to change anything. Lack of you is what can bring death to an inflated ego.</br>
Let’s talk about these rules, which, when you learn, you will create a life of prosperity for yourself and … those who deserve it. 
</p>
<p>
<h5>Your love is a treasure</h5>
Whoever you choose to protect and love automatically gets abundant.  </br>
Did you notice it? I know you have never paid attention, being busy resolving all the obstacles and misfortunes somebody else created.  </br>
It was always your energy paying somebody else’s bills for their bad behaviour, wrong decisions or unacceptable treatment.  </br>
It became so expected and unappreciated by others that you started doubting it and yourself.  </br>
Their only job was to trap you in this constant disbelief that you contribute to anything, while it was always only you making any effort. </br>
Look how clever and powerful this trick is. Not seeing yourself as of any value, you help your abuser to disregard and question your biggest treasure - your unconditional love, which, when activated, creates miracles and brings abundance.

This is why they often hoover you back when they are dry of it. </br>
It's time for you to see it, too. And treasure it. Protect.  </br>
Otherwise, your spirit team will send another teacher. 
</p>
<p>
<h5>Lack of reciprocity drains love</h5>
This horrible abuse was designed this way to teach you not to overgive, as one-sided love is toxic. You can not be a source of it, as you would only amplify it with your powers. </br>
Your love can not change people. You have to understand it, and you are here to experience it. Your love is a light for those seeking a brighter path. But never to force people to follow something they do not recognise or do not even see. </br>
Your narcissist will show you this aspect of misuse of unconditional love perfectly. They were made blind to good energy and prefer a superficial life. To make you understand the rights of their free will and accept others' unwillingness to improve. </br>
This experience has only one aim: to show you that love exists only between people. Only one person can’t perform it. </br>
Reciprocity, people exchanging equally, is a solution.

</p>
<p>
<h5>Not rescuing when not asked</h5>
You violate others’ free will when you jump to rescue people you think need your help. </br>
Your heart is naturally pulled towards narcissists as it knows that you are their perfect medicine. This is why your spiritual team sent you to the Earth to fall in love with a narcissist, as it was predictable for a rescuer to happen.</br>
They wanted you to see by yourself that people change only after making that decision themselves and mostly under pressure. </br>
You can only serve directions and wisdom … when asked.</br>
Otherwise, their ego will feel threatened. </br>

Tell me, who else, if not a narcissist, would help you to learn that?</br>
They do not have any defence against advice in the form of constructive criticism. They are automatically triggered. It teaches you quickly. </br>
They do an amazing job here.</br>
I love this game. I know how to play now :)
