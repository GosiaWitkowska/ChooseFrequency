<h5>Narcissistic abuse as a trigger for spiritual awakening</h5>
<p>
When you awaken this lifetime, you will gain spiritual powers, abilities you cannot access while asleep.</br> 
I talk extensively about them on my YouTube channel, blogs or classes and how your frequency builds their strength. </br>
But I did not mention yet how to trigger their birth. <span class="special-text">Spiritual awakening</span> is the only way. It is difficult as the human brain and its ego are designed to protect you from any changes, preventing unnecessary risk. </br>
But in everybody’s life comes a time when we understand enough to estimate risk and are ready for growth and new experiences. </br>
Your higher self knows it for sure as it sees all your possible timelines, and when most of them go the wrong way, it triggers a bomb. Something severe enough to wake the sleepy beauty up. </br>
The easiest way for your spirit guides to trigger this process is to use an abusive relationship, as it will definitely shake you to your core and force revalue all principles. 
And narcissists come here to the rescue. Would you create a better predator? It will awaken people when nothing else worked. Lucky us :) </br>
Are you asking why you need to suffer? I will give you a few reasons which will change your life. That is precisely what this whole process is about. </br>

</p>
<p>
<h5>To see your empathy</h5>
And its power. People can mostly notice the value of anything by comparing it with something else. The quickest way is to do it with the opposite, which does not have features you should notice. <br/>
For example, like in advertising techniques: Our bank is family-friendly because, compared to the one from the corner, we have small loans with 0% interest for three months.  <br/>
The same system works when your spiritual team wants you to eventually see that you have empathy and start using it as a power tool. <br/>
Narcissists are unfortunate souls who, due to early age abuse mostly by their parents, decided to switch their empathy off. <br/>
They went through life mainly treating others as their narcissistic supply, creating karma. Your higher self can use this energetical doubt to make them attack you long enough for you to reach a point when change is the only option. <br/>
When awakening in your own defence is a spark of your new life. <br/>
Narcissists use a smear campaign to make you lose friends and family. It helps as, in the end, you can not rely on anybody to force yourself to use your empathy to heal and find out how powerful you are. Amazing. 
</p>
<p>
<h5>To force you to look for your purpose</h5>
Losing a person who you once loved and might have created a trauma bond with is not the only loss. Your narcissists will make sure you will not have anybody around you when the discard takes place. </br>
What will you be left with? </br>
Drained from people and often resources. New journeys, ideas, and desires suddenly find space in your mind. </br>
You are ready and willing to develop your ... purpose. </br>
<img class="image-center" src="../images/blog/purpose.jpg" alt="purpose"/>
You have to admit they use a clever trick. It is almost like spirits created narcissists to do for them a dirty work. Do you think is it cruel? Spirits only job is to create more of themselves. They want you to wake up and join them. Another option is to stay amongst zombies. They want to rescue you. </br>
Humans are lazy and often stuck in an easy life, never risking anything to compromise their comfort zone. Not anymore!</br>
The Divine created their warriors. To prove it, please notice what happens when you heal and forgive after narcissists deliver their ultimate weapon. You will create a miracle as they will change, too.</br>
Your forgiveness will switch their empathy back. They still will need help and time to heal.</br>
Let them find another healer as your journey … the new one … just started, and you are free. 
</p>
<p>
<h5>To break generational curses</h5>
Narcissism is passed through generations. From parents to children. These people chose to become the same as their abusers to survive. </br>
But there is another path for those wanting to keep their empathy. Becoming a rescuer. Somebody who can explain everything and everybody to ease the situation and make it work. Somebody who trains themself unconsciously to be a perfect person, partner and eventually a target for abusers. This way, it is easy to misunderstand love with abuse and find yourself in a long-lasting narcissistic relationship. </br>
Not knowing what love is as you might never experienced it, not even from your parents. </br>
It would mean that narcissism is in your family, and choosing the path of being different, you agreed to be a scapegoat and give a chance to your family by breaking this generational curse. </br>
Healing yourself and standing against a narcissist, you show an example to those who should love you but could not. Still loving them but setting healthy boundaries, you do not let them have other choices but at least to see that they have something to heal. </br>
Be a hero. Transform and transmute the pain of all around you.
