<h5>Ascension. Shifting to a higher dimension.</h5>
<p>
In spiritual awakening and growth, breaking chains with what we are familiar with is essential. The main aim of this whole process is to make you self-aware and conscious. 
</br>
Ascending, moving energetically to a different dimension starts with changing your mindset and can get much easier if you connect with a higher consciousness for guidelines.
</br>
All this process is for only one reason. To make you change or create your own dimensions. Mindset. To squeeze out from you your potential. To challenge you to change your current circumstances and surroundings. 
</br>
It can only be achieved with lighter vibrations and higher frequency. The easiest way do it is to stay pure. What does it mean to you? For me, it means no lying, stealing, or harming others. 
</br>
What about no having bad intentions anymore? Easy? Try. You will be tested. People will try to trigger you, betray you, harm you. 
Will you stay clean from wishing them bad luck in return? 
Sending something back to the sender seems to be so innocent. Is it? 
Ultimately, it is about wishing somebody to have a bad experience. 
The Universe just uses these people to see your reaction. 
</br>
We should not give any thought to something which can pollute our energy. For us to hear messages lauder, being pure is only a preparation. What comes later makes a true story. 
</br>  
Can it be that <span class="special-text">Jesus Christ </span>set a footprint? I believe that he was an enlightened person and a huge influencer. 
Somebody who knew and had a recipe for ascension. But without social media, he could not reach out to large enough audience on time, before people called him God.

I find his journey fascinating and a perfect example if you want to use a Christ Consciousness to change yours. You can pick up any other consciousness of higher vibrations to increase your frequency.
</br>
</p>

<h5>Temptation</h5>
Changing dimensions during ascension was never easy. Mainly because each of them holds a different type of energy, and you have to exhibit a proper frequency if you at least want to see a higher vibing side of reality. 
</br>  
Three dimensional World is about body pleasures and matter. There is nothing wrong with it, but if you are craving something of a different nature, you have to be able to change your frequency. 
</br>  
Are you asking what might be there? 
</br>  
You can gain access to the consciousness you are connected to. 
</br>  
You can use other’s knowledge and skills by tapping into this global awareness of higher vibing entities. 
</br>  
Ability to move back and forth in time and set synchronicities for it to play out now. For yourself or others. 
</br>  
The other thing would be you being able to create, build and jump new timelines. 
</br>  
But my favourite one is creating completely different dimensions with its new consciousness. You can place there as many unique things as your imagination can produce.
</br>  
You would never be able to change your current dimension if you were easily tempted by what it can offer. As long as you enjoy it, it serves its purpose. It makes you fulfilled … until you want something else. But you would not be able to find what once satisfied you in a new dimension. Therefore, when you leave one, you must change your desires. 
</br>  
</p>
<p>
<h5>Sacrifice </h5>
Ascension is one of the most significant changes you will ever have. It reshapes the inner world and our mindset. It is not you choosing it. It is your higher self craving it and knowing when you are ready, as it has access to all your possible timelines you can create. It sees if there is already the one where you survived all necessary steps, which your current existence would call cruel.  
</br> 
Like for example, losing your child due to divorce, friends, house, job, or finances. Sacrifice must be made not to scorn you but rather to show you the insignificance of everything present in your current life. For you to learn how to release your anchors to it and stop being dependand on anything.

</br> 
You might be questioning how family can be not important. But you asking for ascension means you want to change your energetical family. 
You do not have to go through the process alone, but you should not convince or force anybody to do that with you, who is not ready and does not want to go on that journey with you. 
They have the right to make that decision on their terms and in their time. You have the right to release everything and everybody, too. 
</br> 
You will raise your vibrations as soon as you stop belonging to known reality. Enjoy your new existence. 
 </p>
 <p>
 <h5>Crucifixion</h5>
 The crowd. 
 </br> 
What meaning does it have for you? How precious it is for you?
</br> 
How much you would do or give up on to be surrounded by people, friends, family, and colleagues?
</br> 
Would you betray yourself to avoid people banishing or harming you, or would you let them go as far as they want to see how far it is? 
</br> 
You need to be able to resurrect from anything to change your vibrations and reality together with it.   
</br> 
What will be your story? <span class="special-text">Resurrection</span> is just about changing dimensions.

</br> 
When you are ready, the Universe will set the scene for you, the whole show. You are probably asking why would you want to experience anything like that. 
</br> 
How else would you trigger your higher vibrations? Public humiliation is the most challenging event to survive. When checking our child's capabilities, we often take it to a carousel before a rollercoaster. 
On higher vibrations, it is much easier to get distorted. You have to be able to handle this kind of situation with ease. You can change your vibration and frequency only if you can de-anchor yourself from anybody. Not only physically but mentally. Releasing any grudges is the main rule. 
</br> 
There is no chance for your light to get brighter if you are waiting for Karma to fight for you and bring justice. And it had to be a group of people otherwise, you could play a judge yourself if there was only one person. 
</br> 
It all will be planned to test you and show you your strength. Jesus had last supper with just few people ... to say goodbye and went his own way. He did not need the crowd anymore.
