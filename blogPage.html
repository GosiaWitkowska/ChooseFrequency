					<h5><a href="single-post.html">3 signs you are already in a higher dimension </a></h5>
<p>
What we do not perceive by our 5 senses does not exist? Let's not be silly. 
We see only a small range of light spectrum from 400 nm to 700 nm. Rest is not visible to huma’s eye, at least to those who don't want to see more.
</p>
<img class="image-center" src="images/blog/solar-spectrum.jpg" alt="solar spectrum"/>
<p>
We can hear only a small portion of sound ranging from 20Hz to 20kHz. But dolphins and bats can hear frequencies over 100kHz. Elephants can hear sound at 14-16Hz, while some whales can hear infrasonic sounds as low as 7Hz.
<img class="image-center" src="images/blog/champ_auditif_en2.jpg" alt="auditory range"/>
</p><p>
Let's talk about brainwave frequencies. These waves range from 12Hz to 38Hz. 
Gamma (awareness), Beta (alertness), Alpha (relaxed, ready to be hypnotised), Theta (tired), Delta (Sleep).
But I am listing only human’s brain capabilities. Research shows that animals can produce unusually slow waves cycling just twice per second. These waves were very strong suggesting a high level of synchronisation between neurons. And it mostly happened when octopuses were synchronising their movements. Telepathy? But this includes  the heart neurons. People do not understand yet that looking only at the main brain is only the beginning. The whole mystery behind creation is in coherently synchronising both neuron’s centres.
<img class="image-center" src="images/blog/brainheartcohirance.jpg" alt="Heart Brain Coherence"/>
</p><p>
The heart contains an intrinsic nervous system that exhibits both short and long-term memory functions. The intrinsic nervous system of the heart consists of approximately 40,000 neurons called sensory neurites which relay information to the brain.
And it is most likely to see communication  going from the heart to the brain. It looks like our brain relies on information from our heart. 
<br/>
	If  humans think they see, hear, sense all and that there is no more than we truly deserve only these five senses we recognise.
What if there is more and you could access different frequencies, develop new skills and experience unseen, unknown … dimensions. Something not accessible … yet. 

</p><p>
<h5>Becoming invisible</h5>

When we go through a transformation, we change. It is inevitable. It should not surprise us more than others. What do I mean by that?
Don’t be disappointed when people will stop understanding you or even noticing. 
They can not walk with you along the road they do not see. And you can not go back to the one they are on. 
You raise your vibrations when you seek more. You see what you can have and experience. And what is more profand you know you can not find it where you have been before. 
You talk differently, You behave differently. You do not react anymore to certain triggers because they lose meaning in your eyes. And because of that you can not be controlled anymore by others or the environment itself. 
Sooner or later these people will stop seeing your energy. As humans need to be able to comprehend what they experience otherwise it is irrelevant to their perception. 
You might be willing to dense your energy temporarily to be able to communicate.  
But when you start attracting your new soul tribe you will not have time or desire to chase previous roles.
Your frequency will become noticeable only by different entities. These which can amplify it by aligning together. You will want to become an entity from a different dimension as you will start seeing more of yourself there. 

</p><p>
<h5>Seeing more synchronicities</h5>

	Recently I wrote another article about synchronicities where I explain what they are and how important role they play in our life. These are no numeric sequences but rather synchronised events involving any type of energies, to benefit us. People call them coincidences by mistake. It is possible to generate them yourself and control it. 
Seeing synchronicities and recognising their meaning is a start of the journey which can change not only your life but existence as well. 
Human’s civilisation meant to progress, expand, grow, evolve. This is a time for another gens revolution. We are capable of developing capabilities beyond five common senses. And it only depends on us what it will be. Those who will take part in the process. Believe in yourself and your downloads. One soul, one mind, one divided awareness is enough to change it all. This was the main reason why the whole Consciousness divided. To speed up experience and to have more chances to create new things. It is why it is important for you to not get biassed by any norms and go wild with your imagination. 
Depending on which dimension you occupy, you get particular access to heighten awareness and its resources. 
We have to first start seeing it. It’s power and abilities. 
How something else than just faith shapes our World. Nothing's a coincidence. Might sound like a slogan but when you start examining it, you will find a World of magic … not from the third dimension. 

</p><p>
<h5>Body and Mind changes</h5>

There is no other way to allow a transformation than letting it in and letting it raise your vibrations. How? Let it rule you for a moment and learn how to do it yourself. 
<br/>
During a spiritual awakening you will experience voices, feelings, urges for new, different or even strange things. Go for it. Let this frequency enter your body and learn all about it. Be a radio for a moment and play the music you capture from the weather just tune to a new frequency. Start changing it to the point when it will resonate with your soul. It will be a sign your HigherSelf found its reality. 
<br/>
To shift to a different dimension they (spirit guides, entities) have to change your brain flexibility. It is why you might feel addicted to learning and courses. 
<br/>
They need to change your cellular structure to let you live longer. I wrote before about ways to extend our DNA chromosomes by extending telomeres. This is why gradually you stop eating meat, sugar, heavy meals.Food in general might stop interesting you. 
<br/>
They need to change your focus.It is why suddenly you will realise that you do not remember when you watched the last episode of your favourite drama or TV in general. 
You will not be able to chat with your friends anymore because you will not know where there is a War now and who won in football recently. 
<br/>
<div class="blog-quote">
"Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people." <br/>
<auth>~Socrates</auth>
</div>

They just are clearing your mind as you are meant to start seeing a different dimension where maybe War, football, money and food does not exist anymore. 
<br/>
After that you have a choice to make. Are you asking what is there? Magic.
Your own World. You can make whatever you want. It belongs to you. Your dimension. 
Where would you find better entertainment if not creating it yourself? 
<br/>
Really. Show me what you can come up with!

					<h5><a href="single-post.html">3 ways to align with Schuman Resonance - Earth's frequency</a></h5>
					<p>The Shumann Resonances are a set of frequencies produced by electromagnetic waves in Earth’s lower ionosphere. It’s created by thunderstorms and lightning around the Globe. It’s called Earth’s heartbeat. It matches the frequency of human alpha brain waves.</p>
