<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You do not even know what a powerful being you are. For many people, spiritual awakening brings only the beginning to the most profound understanding of the powers around us. Explaining which, using only what is available to our human perception, is beyond comprehension.
It is only possible when you trust yourself strongly enough to let your imagination and intuition build your belief system. Releasing yourself from the matrix of standard customs and rules is vital on this quest to find your grail.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When you have achieved all the goals you planned when you were young, what else could be more exciting than the game you have not yet seen? The game has yet to be described. You will not find it in any book from your childhood or the lives of any friends you know.
Something exciting that would keep you interested enough to keep you playing.
You know all the tricks and what to do in almost every situation; you have mastered all possible responses to achieve satisfying outcomes. What can challenge you and ignite the spark? What about creating your own game? Yes, you can.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Synchronicities let you design and set new boards for the games where only your imagination can limit you.
Seeing energy around you, you can shape it into whatever comes to your mind. Making people play roles you assign to them and letting you enjoy your new experiences, allowing it to entertain you and teach you the necessary skills to build more advanced strategies later on.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember, the main rule is not to harm any energy. You contribute to the Collective of your choice to enrich its frequency and your potential to access higher levels of Consciousness.
Increasing your abilities and opportunities might look like a goal until you understand it has a different meaning. Uniting in Oneness to share knowledge and experience makes the observing process more intricate and advanced. Seeing yourself as a part of something - something which wanted to see everything from many perspectives and fragmented itself to give itself that option. It created you and all there is, from itself - to have pawns to play with.  </p>


<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It might sound cruel, but only for those who do not want to see more. They will never be ready to do what needs to take place. We are not meant to find out what that 'more' is - but to create it. To understand that evolution never was, it is. 
To use its power, and with your imagination, show the Universe something it has never seen before. We are just entertainers to ourselves."</p>
